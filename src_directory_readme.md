#src Directory

This directory should contain all sources for libraries, but unfortunately GitHub limits the number of files for each directory to 1000 files, and some libraries have up to 1700 files.

For this reason the src directory is incomplete, and whole sources have been added in the src_directory.zip file.

Use it for sources.
