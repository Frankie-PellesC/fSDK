# To Do
- After the fixing (hopefully) of MS/PellesC intrinsics compliance (waiting for bug reports) the big deal is how to support intrinsics/functions not available in PellesC.
Using the MSVC runtime, instead of the PellesC own runtime, can solve the problem of the missing functions, but not the issue of the missing intrinsics.
- Fixing D2D1.h and its family. Nobody in Redmond checked if those headers can really work. They are full of bugs, just wrote down because they had to supply them... >:(

Working on it.
