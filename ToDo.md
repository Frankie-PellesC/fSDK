After fixing of MS/PellesC intrinsics compliance (waiting for bug reports) the big deal is how to support required intrinsics/functions non available in PellesC.
The use of MSVC runtime, instead of the PellesC one, can solve the problem of the missing functions, but the intrinsics probllem remains.

Working on it.
