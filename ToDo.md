After the fixing (hopefully) of MS/PellesC intrinsics compliance (waiting for bug reports) the big deal is how to support intrinsics/functions not available in PellesC.
Using the MSVC runtime, instead of the PellesC own runtime, can solve the problem of the missing functions, but not the issue of the missing intrinsics.

Working on it.
